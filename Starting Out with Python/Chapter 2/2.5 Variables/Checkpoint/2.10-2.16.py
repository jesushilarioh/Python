# 2.13 Is the following assignment statement valid or invalid? If it is invalid, why?
# 72 = amount
# ANSWER: Invalid. When assigning a number to a variable, 
#         the value must be on the right side of the (=) operator.
#         Or the variable that is receiving the assignment must appear 
#         on the left side of the = operator.

# value2 = 45.9     FLOAT
# value3 = 7.0      FLOAT
# value4 = 7        INT
# value5 = 'abc'    STR
# After these statements execute, what is the Python data type of 
# the values referenced by each variable?
# 
# 2.16 What will be displayed by the following program?
# my_value = 99 
# my_value = 0
