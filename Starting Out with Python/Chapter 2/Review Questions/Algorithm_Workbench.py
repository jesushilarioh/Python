# 4. Assume the variables result, w, x, y, and z are all 
# integers, and that w = 5, x = 4, y = 8, and z = 2. 
# What value will be stored in result after each of 
# the following statements execute?
# a. result=x+y         = 12
# b. result=z * 2       = 4
# c. result=y / x       = 2.0
# d.result=y – z        = 6
# e. result=w // z      = 2
w = 5 
x = 4 
y = 8

# 5. Write a Python statement that assigns the product 
# of 10 and 15 to the variable product.
product = 10 + 15
print('product =', product)

# 6. Write a Python statement that subtracts the 
# variable down_payment from the variable
# total and assigns the result to the variable due.
total = 8700
down_payment = 900
due = total - down_payment

# 7. Write a Python statement that multiplies the 
# variable subtotal by 0.15 and assigns
# the result to the variable total.
subtotal = 300
total = subtotal * 0.15

# 8. What would the following display?
# a= 5
# b= 2
# c= 3
# result = a + b * c 
# print(result)             = 11
a = 5
b = 2
c = 3
result = a + b * c
print('result = ', result)

# 9. What would the following display?
# num = 99 
# num = 5 
# print(num)            = 5
num = 99
num = 5
print('num =', num)

# 10. Assume the variable sales references a float 
# value. Write a statement that displays the 
# value rounded to two decimal points.
sales = 500.0
print('sales =', format(sales, '.2f'))

# 11. Assume the following statement has been executed:
# number = 1234567.456
# Write a Python statement that displays the value 
# referenced by the number variable formatted as
# 1,234,567.5
number = 1234567.456
print('number =', format(number, ',.1f'))

# 12. What will the following statement display?
# print('X\tO\tX\nO\tX\tO\nX\tO\tX\n') =X   O   X   O   X   O   X   O
print('X\tO\tX\tO\tX\tO\tX\tO\tX')

# 13. Write a turtle graphics statement that draws 
# a circle with a radius of 75 pixels.
# VideoNote
# The Sales Prediction Problem
# 14. Write the turtle graphics statements to draw 
# a square that is 100 pixels wide on each side and 
# filled with the color blue.

# 15. Write the turtle graphics statements to draw 
# a square that is 100 pixels wide on each side and 
# a circle that is centered inside the square. The 
# circle’s radius should be 80 pixels. The circle 
# should be filled with the color red. (The square
