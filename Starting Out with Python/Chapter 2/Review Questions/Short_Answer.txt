2. How does pseudocode differ from actual code written in a programming language?
a). pseudocode code is an informal language that allows programmers to focus more on the program's design,
rather than the on the programming languages syntax rules.

3. Computer programs typically perform what three steps?

b). Process Input
c). Output

4. What rules and considerations should influence the names given to variables in a program?
rules:
a). cannot use Python key words.
b). no spaces

a). it is difficult for someone reading the code to determine the purpose of the magic number
b). it takes laboriuos effort to change each instance of the value in a program
c). a high risk of making mistakes, when typing the magic number in the program's code.

7. Assume a program uses the named constant PI to represent the value 3.14159. The program uses the 
named constant in several statements. What is the advantage of using the named constant instead 
of the actual value 3.14159 in each statement?
There are 3 advantages that come with using a named constant in your program:
a). it make programs more self-explanatory.
b). widespread changes can easily be made to the program.
