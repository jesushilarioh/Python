# 2. Areas of Rectangles
# The area of a rectangle is the rectangleâ€™s length 
# times its width. Write a program that asks for the 
# length and width of two rectangles. The program 
# should tell the user which rectangle has the 
# greater area, or if the areas are the same.

# asks for the length and width of two rectangles.

# area of a rectangle is the rectangleâ€™s 
# length times its width.
