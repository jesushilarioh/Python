# 3. Quarter of the Year
# Write a program that asks the user for a month as 
# a number between 1 and 12. The program should display 
# a message indicating whether the month is in the 
# first quarter, the second quarter, the third 
# quarter, or the fourth quarter of the year. 
# Following are the guidelines:
#
# • If the user enters either 1, 2, or 3, the month is in the first quarter.
# • If the user enters a number between 4 and 6, the month is in the second quarter.
# • If the number is either 7, 8, or 9, the month is in the third quarter.
# • If the month is between 10 and 12, the month is in the fourth quarter.
# • If the number is not between 1 and 12, the program should display an error.
