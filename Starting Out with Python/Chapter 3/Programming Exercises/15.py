# 15. Time Calculator
# Write a program that asks the user to enter a number of 
# seconds and works as follows:
# • There are 60 seconds in a minute. If the number of 
# seconds entered by the user is greater than or equal to 
# 60, the program should convert the number of seconds to 
# minutes and seconds.
# • There are 3,600 seconds in an hour. If the number of 
# seconds entered by the user is greater than or equal to 3,600, 
# the program should convert the number of seconds to hours, 
# minutes, and seconds.
# • There are 86,400 seconds in a day. If the number of 
# seconds entered by the user is greater than or equal to 
# 86,400, the program should convert the number of seconds to 
# days, hours, minutes, and seconds.
