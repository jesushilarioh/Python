# 13. Falling Distance
# When an object is falling because of gravity, 
# the following formula can be used to determine 
# the distance the object falls in a specific time 
# period:

# d = 1/2 gt^2

# The variables in the formula are as follows: d is 
# the distance in meters, g is 9.8, and t is the 
# amount of time, in seconds, that the object has 
# been falling. Write a function named 
# falling_distance that accepts an objectâ€™s 
# falling time (in seconds) as an argument. The 
# function should return the distance, in meters, 
# that the object has fallen during that time 
# interval. Write a program that calls the function 
# in a loop that passes the values 1 through 10 as 
# arguments and displays the return value.


def main():
    for count in range(10):
        print(f"{count + 1}: {falling_distance(count + 1):,.2f}")

def falling_distance(t):
    G = 9.8
    return (1/2) * (G * (pow(t, 2)))
